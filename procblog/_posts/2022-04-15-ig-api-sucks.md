I'm trying to add a feature to this site that shows a feed of my Instagram account's post. However, the gods over at facebook have so valiantly decided that I would need to go through this strenuous process to authenticate my usage of their API. All I want to do is to show my account's feed in the form of embeds.

I am looking into other social media platforms that allow me to do this. I think Twitter might have this functionality but I'll have to look into it. Might be a reason to start using it more. If anyone reading this has any ideas, don't hesitate to [let me know](/socials).

Honestly this post is kind of just filler.
