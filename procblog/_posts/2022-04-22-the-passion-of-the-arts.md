#### passion
/ˈpaSHən/

&emsp;5&emsp;a&emsp;: ardent affection; love

&emsp;2&emsp;*obsolete*: suffering [^1]

<br/>

&emsp;Over the past handful of years, I have had a complicated relationship with the arts. My love for the subject has waned back and forth, just as a tide closes in on the shore only to dissapear in what seems like moments after; the peaks and dips connecting together in a sinusoidal dance, growing ever more intense with the completion of each wavelength; the crests and troughs racing along the invisible asymptotic line illustrating my affection and anger towards the concept as a whole. Of course, this is normal. Perhaps this case is more extreme than others, but the general cyclic nature of interest is intrinsic to any person and their passions. 

&emsp;As a child I was mesmerized by the world of the sciences and mathematics. Nothing would hold my attention more than seeing the universe's nature being laid out in front of me. My desire to know seemed entirely insatiable: there was a constant a torrent of "why?"s and "how?"s spewing out of my mouth, filling my search history and the ears of those around me. For most of my education, this drive was enough to push me to soaring heights. Honour roll after honour roll, I dove head first into the world of academics and thrived. I loved it all. I truly did. As my brain feasted on the cerebral sweets my passion for science and mathematics grew exponentially. Passion, in this case, referring to definition 5: love.

&emsp;I loved the arts. *It was my passion.* It was an integral part of my identity; so much of who was "me" was derived from the arts. But at some point, I stumbled. In the vast sea of academics, I was drowning. I sputtered, gasped, and begged for air: the cold, uncaring expanse embraced me with the warmth and softness of a metal coffin. The ocean that had once been my passion was now suffocating.

&emsp;I think that "interest" is comprised of multiple levels, all of which are dependent on the intellectual stimulation and the contextual environment of the subject at hand. While I swam deeper and deeper into my intellectual and academic pursuits, the pressure slowly built up. I could feel an ever-increasing force applied across my whole being. Before I could react, I was in too deep - expectations, deadlines, and desires had consumed the forefront of my mind. First, passion turned to boredom; boredom turned to disinterest; and from disinterest came disgust. While I struggled to breathe in the depths of scholarship, I grew bitter. As I floated back to the surface to swallow my first breath in years, I would never forget the embarassment an betrayal I had felt. The sensation of my lungs filling to the brim: the suffocating nature of the ocean. Was I too ambitious? Or perhaps I was not as talented as I had believed?
