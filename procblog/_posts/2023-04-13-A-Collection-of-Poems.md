### Untitled (02/13/23)

one day\
i will die\
and my body will rot;\
maggots will feast on my flesh -\
worms fill where my eyes\
once were and i will be thought\
of for the very last time

### Untitled (04/13/23)

I know summer - sunlight, warmth, rest, - is right before me;\
I can taste the cold, crisp, beers;\
I can hear my friends’ carefree conversations;\
I can feel -

Entropy:\
Chaos increases - heat-energy spreads.\
Phase shift:\
Matter transitions - water boils.\
Exothermic:\
Energy released - matter cools.\
the psyche:\
seasons change. hearts freeze.\
time:\
passes.
