hi. this is where I blog about my projects and whatever else I'm interested in. I'm a hobbyist coder and artist. I also enjoy tinkering with hardware and trying to blend all three of my hobbies together. so expect to see a lot of that.

I'm tired of websites that have massive filesizes and overly complicated designs. so naturally, I went in the opposite direction.
